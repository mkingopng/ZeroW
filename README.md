   - convert plots to plotly with hover text
   - get more recent data from thomas

# Marketing and revenue growth
It seems to be pretty much agreed that we need to grow revenue. While there 
is a lot of analysis we can still do, there is also no reason why we can't 
get on with the task of getting more members/customers

# Marketing
- how do we generate leads?
- how do we do most of our marketing?
- what data can we get from historical marketing activities?
- what is our cost of lead generation?
- what is our conversion rate? ie the rate at which we convert leads to memberships
- What marketing activities do we have planned? I know about the school break one. what else?
- what is a reasonable goal for lead generation each month? how can we measure that?
- what is a reasonable goal for new members each month? how can we measure that?
- how many new customers do i need to bring on to cover my costs?


# Membership data

# Marketing Data
# Customer Service (aka retention)
The principle is that if customers are getting good value, they will continue to be members or may upgrade their memberships.
So customer service is the best way to reduce churn. 
- how many customers do we have? what are their levels? how has this changed over time?
- what is our current churn rate? (PaperPlane)
- can we predict which customers are at risk? How?
- what specific actions can we take to reduce churn?
- check accounts vs paperplane just ot be sure it reconciles
