Developing a quality management system (QMS) for ZeroW is a great way for us to grow our membership and to ensure that 
we consistently deliver an awesome product. Below are the steps That i think we need to take to develop a QMS, and a 
culture of continuous improvement

## 1. Vision, Mission, and Values
- **Vision:** Define where we want ZeroW to be in the future, both at an individual level and at a macro level.
- **Mission:** Describe the purpose of ZeroW and what it aims to achieve. Thomas can articulate this pretty clearly, but i want to be able to recite it from memory and from the heart. I want all the OG and staff to be able to as well. 
- **Values:** Clearly define the principles and standards that guide ZeroW’s actions and decisions. These then flow into our policies and te kind of behaviour we expect from our teams.
- For all 3 we need ot be specific and avoid motherhood statements

## 2. Understand Your Stakeholders
- Identify all stakeholders (owners, staff, customers, suppliers, etc.).
- Determine their needs and expectations, 
- note differences in expectations between locations. This is really important. Each gym is unique and we need to retain flexibility

## 3. Define Business and Quality Objectives
- Set clear, measurable business and quality objectives that align with our vision and mission.
- We need to ensure these objectives are realistic and achievable.
- But we also need to ensure that they are aspirational. Our objective is not to stay the same. Its to improve, grow and make more money
- we need to see quality as a fundamental component aligned with our business. It is not separate from the business goals. It supports the business goals

## 4. Develop a Quality Policy
- what is "quality" to ZeroW and its stakeholders? What does it look like?
- Draft a quality objective and policy that reflects ZeroW's goals and commitment to quality.
- Ensure that the goals and policy are communicated and understood within the organization and its stakeholders.

## 5. Document Processes and Procedures
- Identify key processes that impact quality. In our case we're focused on the processes that are critical growing membership numbers, and delivering consistent excellence
- These are not aspirational. They should reflect how we do things now.
- Document procedures for these processes, including responsibilities, inputs, outputs, and performance criteria.
- update these processes and procedures constantly to reflect the way we do things NOW. 
- Expect that to change over time as we learn to do things better, we iteratively update the process

## 6. Establish Roles and Responsibilities
- Define roles and responsibilities related to quality management, and also 
- but more importantly the roles in the organisation. Everyone should be absolutely clear on what they are responsible for, and what is expected of them. It needs to be in writing
- Ensure everyone understands their role in maintaining quality.

## 7. Implement an ongoing Training Program
- we need an onboarding process so that new staff are effective as quickly as possible
- In general right now, new hires are learning by osmosis. That works, but its slow and inconsistent. We can do better.
- When we talk about training, people often default to professional development. There is a place for professional development, but that's not what I'm talking about.
- I'm talking about training people how to do things the ZeroW way.
- A really obvious example is sales and closing in particular. There are very few natural closers. Most people need to be taught and need to practice it regularly. This is not something we would send someone on a sales development course for. We'd d it ourselves.
- We need to repeat it. Just like weight training, you wouldn't expect someone's squat to improve from a single session. It improves by a process of repeated purposeful practice. We need to apply the same thing to our business training
- Develop training programs to ensure employees have the necessary skills and knowledge to consistently deliver a quality product to ZeroW's customers.
- Regularly update training to reflect changes in processes or standards.

## 8. Develop a Monitoring and Measurement System
- Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) to monitor quality objectives.
- Implement regular internal audits to assess compliance with the QMS.

## 9. Implement Corrective and Preventive Actions
- Create a system for identifying and addressing non-conformities.
- Implement processes for continuous improvement, meaning that we constantly look for ways to improve.
- when we identify a better way, we make it our standard way of doing things. Its a kind of continuous evolution
- we update the documented processes as we evolve

## 10. Conduct Management Reviews
- We ned to regularly review and evaluate the effectiveness of the QMS. 
- Is it still meeting the goals of the business?
- Continuous improvement shouldn't be completely organic. The OG needs to be involved in steering the CI system
- We use these reviews to make informed decisions about improvements.

## 11. Maintain Documentation and Records
- this is my job
- Ensure all quality-related documentation and records are controlled and maintained.
- Implement version control and secure storage systems for documentation.

## 12. Foster a Culture of Quality
- Build a culture where quality is everyone’s responsibility, and everyone is enthusiastic to constantly get better
- The values we bring to our lifting should be clear and present in the way we run our businesses.
- Recognize and reward contributions to quality improvement. I really believe that recognition is more important than material rewards. I hate "employee of the month" stuff. I like recognition specifically about an achievement

## 13. Continuous Improvement
- Regularly review and improve the QMS based on feedback and performance data.
- Stay updated with industry standards and best practices.

By following these steps, we will develop a comprehensive and effective quality management system tailored to ZeroW's needs.
